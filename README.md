# Practice for the 70-483 Exam

### Exercise
Create an application that can take an URL as user input, and at the click of a button will download the contents of that URL to a textbox. The application should count how many letters are in the text of the content. No special characters should be included. Only the alphabet should be taken into consideration (you can choose which).

The application should also display those numbers, e.g.:

- A => 139
- B => 24
- C => 0
- D => 99
...

Variations:
* a) Use case insensitive search on the text.
* b) Use case sensitive search on the text.

*Note:* The application must not become unresponsive at any point.

*Note:* A good URL to try this would be the longest article in Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1918_New_Year_Honours
